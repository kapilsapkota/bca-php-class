<p> 
Why do we use it? <br>
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

Strength to War

BY STEPHEN STEPANCHEV

				sfddafafaf sdfafa
Dear stranger, reading this small, true book
By a simple man who loved much and wasn't loved,
Merging your own life with the lines on this page,
Lines that remind you of some frightening shore,
Cold rains, shipwreck, and loud winds and waves,
Stirring your lonely mind with brutal images
That conjure loves forgotten, fears disclaimed,
Joining your pulse with mine, tasting my blood,

The salt, salt blood of a tortured, common man,
What can I say, stranger, what say of war
To limber fear-stiff fingers, give one strength
Against the exploding years, the enclosing dark?

It is indeed night and cold. Wind-blown mist
Spins from the river, shrouds valley and hill-top,
Binding my eyes. My post: three blocks in circuit.
My law: the safety of others: a guard's aim.
My boots make sounds in the gravel where I walk,
My rifle jiggles the shoulder gas mask binding,
My leggings rustle to unseen forest leaves.
But my pulse, too, strikes loud at my wakeful ears,
Loud as the irate colonel and the clamoring world,
And I think a soldier's thoughts of time foregone,
Of fervor of an apple branch in June,
And a lover's hand brushing my casual sleeve.
How kill the brown-haired image, how end the desperate need?
Who'll smirk at the eye clouded, the mouth shaken,
The gentle hand wavering at the gun?

Dear stranger, there is loss, forever loss,
And what we add to life we later subtract
In bitterness and age and friendlessness.
A man earns strength to war only by dying.
